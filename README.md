# [WIP] Dead Simple Shell ( DSS )

A minimal UNIX shell clone in Rust

### Reference:

- I am currently building this using as reference: https://github.com/tokenrove/build-your-own-shell/
- Also I am experimenting with C, cause I felt it's easier to play with syscalls/exit codes, etc. in C for starters. This is done with the help of: https://indradhanush.github.io/blog/writing-a-unix-shell-part-1/ ( this has 3 parts, just replace last 1, with 2 and 3 respecitvely )
